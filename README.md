## How It Works (The AI Magic) ü™Ñ

Our app leverages advanced AI models:

1.  **Computer Vision:** For the photo logging feature, we use sophisticated image recognition models trained on vast datasets of food images to identify different food items on your plate.
2.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** For text/voice logging, NLP techniques understand your descriptions, extract food items and quantities, and match them to our database.
3.  **Machine Learning:** The app learns your preferences and habits over time to provide smarter suggestions and more accurate estimations.
